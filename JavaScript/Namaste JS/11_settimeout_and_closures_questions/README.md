# Printing Numbers with `setTimeout` in JavaScript

This example demonstrates how to print numbers 1 to 5 after an interval of 1 second each using `setTimeout` and a `for` loop.

### Code:

```javascript
// Q. Print Numbers 1 to 5 after an interval of 1 second each using var in for loop

function printNumbers() {
  for (var i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log(i);
    }, i * 1000);
  }
}
// printNumbers()
```
````

### Explanation:

The issue in the code arises because `var` is function-scoped, meaning the variable `i` is shared across all iterations of the loop.
As the `setTimeout` callbacks form closures, they capture the reference to `i` rather than its value at each iteration.
By the time the callbacks execute after the loop completes, the value of `i` is 6, resulting in 6 being logged five times.

### Solution 1: Using `let` Keyword

Instead of `var`, we can use `let`, which is block-scoped. This means each iteration creates a different reference for `i`,
so each loop iteration has its own scope. With 5 iterations, 5 block scopes are created, each having different values. This will print the desired output.

```javascript
function printNumbers2() {
  for (let i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
    setTimeout(() => console.log(i), i * 1000);
  }
}
// printNumbers2()
```

### Solution 2: Using `var` with Function Scope

Another solution is to create a function inside the loop. This ensures that a new value of `i` is created on each iteration, preventing the shared reference issue.

```javascript
function printNumbers3() {
  for (var i = 1; i < 6; i++) {
    function print() {
      var x = i;
      setTimeout(() => console.log(x), x * 1000);
    }
    print();
  }
}
// printNumbers3()
```

### Closures Examples for Data Hiding and Encapsulation

In JavaScript, closures are often used for data hiding and encapsulation, allowing variables to be kept private and not modified directly.

```javascript
var count = 0;

function counter() {
  count++;
  console.log(count);
}

counter();
counter();
counter();
```

### Issue with Global Variables

The problem here is that anyone can change the value of `count` globally, which might lead to incorrect behavior in our `counter` function.

```javascript
count = 99;

counter();
```

### Using Closures to Encapsulate Data

To solve this, we can use closures to encapsulate the `count` variable, making it inaccessible from the global scope. This way, we can only manipulate `count` through the closure function.

```javascript
function counterNew() {
  var count = 0;
  return function () {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}

const counterFn = counterNew();
counterFn();
counterFn();
counterFn();
counterFn();
counterFn();
counterFn();
counterFn();
```

### Scaling the Counter Using Constructor Function

Closures can also be scaled to handle more complex scenarios, such as using constructor functions to manage state.

```javascript
function Counter() {
  this.count = 0;
}

Counter.prototype.increment = function () {
  this.count++;
  console.log(this.count);
};

Counter.prototype.decrement = function () {
  this.count--;
  console.log(this.count);
};

const counter3 = new Counter();
counter3.increment();
counter3.decrement();
```

### Relationship between Garbage Collection (GC) and Closures

One disadvantage of using too many closures is that they can take up more memory. In JavaScript, variables and functions that are not in use are removed from memory via garbage collection. However, because closures hold references to variables from their lexical scope, those variables are not garbage collected and will remain in memory.

Modern browsers use smart garbage collection techniques to handle this efficiently.

```javascript
function counter4() {
  var count = 0;
  const a = 10; // Since 'a' is not used in the closure function, it will be garbage collected using smart garbage collection.
  return function () {
    count++;
    console.log(count);
  };
}
```

```

```
