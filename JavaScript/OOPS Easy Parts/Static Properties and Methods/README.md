### Static Properties and Methods

Suppose if we need to add some utility properties and methods on a class but we do not want that the objects created from the class can access it or these properties or methods get inherited to sub classes. Then we use the `static keyword ` for this purpose.

Static keyword are used to add utility methods and properties to a class not needed for objects it creates.
For example `Math.random()` and `Object.hasOwnProperty()` are static methods added to `Math` and `Object` class.
