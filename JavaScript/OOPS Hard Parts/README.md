# What is OOP and why we need it?
OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) stands for Object-Oriented Paradigm. A paradigm is simply a way to structure or organize our code.

In procedural programming, it becomes hard to manage or understand the code as it grows because everything is written as a sequence of steps, doing this and that. In contrast, OOP organizes code into classes, where each class contains only properties and methods related to it. A class is like a blueprint for creating objects. Each object is an instance of a class and can have its own unique data and behavior.

### A good paradigm must have these characteristics:
- **Easy to add features and functionality**
We should use a paradigm where adding new features is easy, not difficult.

- **Easy for us and other developers to understand**
The paradigm should be simple enough for both current and future developers to grasp quickly.

- **Does not hamper performance**
The paradigm should not organize the code in a way that makes it slow or uses too much memory.

**Note:- OOP has all 3 characteristics**

### OOPS have 4 pillars
1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polyphorphism
