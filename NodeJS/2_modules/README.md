### Modules
In Node.js, a module is simply a separate file or a piece of code that we can reuse in other parts of our application.
Each file in Node.js is automatically treated as a separate module. And isolated from other files by default.
Modules keep code organized, private, and manageable.

Types of Modules:
Local Modules
➔ Modules that we create ourselves inside our project.
(Example: user.js, auth.js)

Built-in Modules
➔ Modules that Node.js provides by default — no installation needed.
(Example: fs, path, http)

Third-party Modules
➔ Modules that we install from npm (Node Package Manager).
(Example: express, mongoose, dotenv)
